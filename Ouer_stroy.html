        <p class="Ouerstroy_text"><i>In 2014, the iconic jewellery house revived a 120 year old tradition</i></p>
        <p class="Ouerstroy_text_1"><b>In 1904</b>, in the vibrant land of India, a renowned jeweller named F. Chand found himself captivated by a peculiar discovery brought forth by one of his esteemed clients. It was a waxy rock-like substance known as Ambergris, a highly coveted and exceptional perfumery material derived from the digestive system of sperm whales. Possessing a delicate and enchanting marine-like scent, Ambergris was known for its exorbitant value. Intrigued by its allure, F. Chand acquired some Ambergris from his client.</p>
